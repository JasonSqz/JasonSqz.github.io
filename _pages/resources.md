I want to share some of the amazing online resources I have utilized during my learning. I have went through all the resources listed and think they are excellent in quality.

1.  [CS224n Natural Language for Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

    Truly amazing course on NLP offered publicly by Stanford. The class made lectures publicly available. Also include five well-structured assignments and final projects to give you hands-on experience.
