Through my studies, I have conducted many projects in various topics. I want to showcase them and keep track of them on this page. 

## 1. [Elon Musk On Twitter](https://jasonsqz.github.io/ElonMuskTwitter/)

This is a project studying discussions of Elon Musk on Twitter. The report combined analysis and visualizations to present what we learnt from the data. It is hosted on GitHub as a bookdown page.

## 2. <a href="https://edav.info">edav.info</a>

I am currently building `edav.info`, which is an additional resource for GR5293 Statistical Graphics and GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization courses offered at Columbia University. The website introduces R graphing techniques and is updated at a weekly basis.

## 3. [Recommender System](/files/recommender_system.pdf) 

We created a recommender system using Amazon review dataset. We applied both content-based and collaborative filtering and reported the results.

## 4. [Studying Correlation between COVID-19 Related Tweets and Policies](/files/twitter_analysis.pdf)

This study is the start of my exploration into data science. We proposed a question, collected data, and answered the question through analysis. It might be naive and flawed in methodology and analysis, it is still a project worth presenting.

## 5. [Bookstore system](https://github.com/JasonSqz/bookstore_system)

For this project, I constructed both the front-end interface and back-end management system for the bookstore website page. Users can look up on books by name, ISBN, and author.
Managers accounts can add, delete, and update books and manage user accounts. Now the webpage is detached from the database and only the source codes are available. In the future, I want to set up the website with cloud services.
