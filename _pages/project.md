Through my studies, I have conducted many projects in various topics. I want to showcase them and keep track of them on this page. 

## 1. [Elon Musk On Twitter](https://jasonsqz.github.io/ElonMuskTwitter/)

This is a project studying discussions of Elon Musk on Twitter. The report combined analysis and visualizations to present what we learnt from the data. It is hosted on GitHub as a bookdown page.

## 2. <a href="https://edav.info">edav.info</a>

I am currently building `edav.info`, which is an additional resource for GR5293 Statistical Graphics and GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization courses offered at Columbia University. The website introduces R graphing techniques and is updated at a weekly basis.

## 3. [Recommender System](/files/recommender_system.pdf) 

We created a recommender system using Amazon review dataset. We applied both content-based and collaborative filtering and reported the results.

## 4. [Understanding the Correlation between COVID-19 Related Tweets and National Policies](/files/twitter_analysis.pdf)

This study is the start of my exploration into data science. We proposed a question, collected data, and answered the question through analysis. It might be naive and flawed in methodology and analysis, it is still a project worth presenting.
