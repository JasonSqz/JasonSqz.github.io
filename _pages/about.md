### Student at Columbia University

I am Senqi Zhang, a Master's student major in Data Science at Columbia University. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Data Science at University of Rochester. 


### Why Data Science

My path on Data Science starts at the begining of 2020. At the time I just returned to Rochester for the last semester of my junior year. Not long after I left Wuhan, my hometown, COVID-19 was reported and lockdown followed. In response to COVID-19 outbreak, I started a project to analyze Twitter users' discussion on policies related to the pandemic. In the following years, I have then conducted various studies relating to social media data. I gradually understand the pipeline of utilizing data to solve problems and I like telling stories using data. Driven by the interest, I am constantly learning towards a real data scientist.
